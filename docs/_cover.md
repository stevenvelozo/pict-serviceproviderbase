# Pict-ServiceProviderBase <small>1</small>

> The Pict-specific service base class, bridging Fable's dependency injection into Pict applications.

- Extends `fable-serviceproviderbase` with a `this.pict` reference
- Inherits Fable DI: logging, UUID, service map, configuration
- Supports standard and core pre-initialization service patterns
- Used across the Retold ecosystem (Pict views, providers, sections)
